### Fixed

- **Screen Rotation Stability**: Fixed `RepoNotInit` errors during device screen rotation

- **Git Operation Queue and Debouncing**: Implemented a unified queue system for all git operations to prevent data races and ensure proper debouncing
  - Commits are queued and executed immediately when it's their turn
  - Pull operations are queued with configurable debouncing delay (default 5 seconds) to prevent excessive syncs during rapid editing
  - Pull operations are immediate for app startup and manual refresh, but delayed for note changes
  - Ensures at least one pull/push operation after the last commit to keep remote repository in sync
  - Prevents conflicts between simultaneous commit and pull operations
  - Consolidates multiple commit operations into single commits with detailed change logs

  - Database commit hash is only updated after successful pulls that bring remote changes
  - Prevents database reloading when background sync only pushes local commits
  - Eliminates UI flickering during rapid consecutive note changes
