## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- App Crash on Screen Rotation: Fixed crash that occurred when rotating the device screen twice
  - Added repository validity checks in Rust code to prevent accessing invalid repository state during Activity recreation
  - Functions like `get_timestamps()`, `last_commit()`, `signature()`, `commit_all()`, `push()`, `pull()`, `sync()`, `is_change()`, and `get_git_log()` now gracefully handle cases where the repository becomes invalid after screen rotation
  - Prevents "panic occurred: unknown" and SIGABRT crashes during device rotation
- Database Sync Optimization: Improved database synchronization to prevent excessive syncing during Activity recreation
  - Moved database sync logic from individual ViewModels to MainViewModel after repository initialization
  - Prevents race conditions where Git operations occur before repository is fully opened during Activity recreation
  - Added timing-based throttling to database sync operations - sync only occurs if more than 5 minutes have passed since the last sync
  - Maintains database freshness while reducing resource usage and preventing crashes
  - Modified tryInit to handle already initialized repositories without failing
  - Added check to skip database update if repository is in invalid state
  - Database sync runs asynchronously in the background to avoid blocking app startup
  - Prevents multiple concurrent sync jobs from being launched
  - **App Startup Sync**: Modified app startup to always perform sync operations when the app is opened, ensuring users see current data regardless of when they last used the app
  - **Database Update After Git Operations**: Fixed issue where database was updated before git operations completed, ensuring UI reflects the latest remote changes- **User Feedback for Repo Opening**: Added loading indicator when opening existing repositories to prevent user confusion during the database sync process- Timestamp Calculation Performance: Dramatically improved database resync performance from minutes to seconds
  - Optimized timestamp calculation algorithm from O(files × commits) to O(commits × modified_files)
  - Changed from per-file commit traversal to processing commits in chronological order and updating all modified files
  - Reduced excessive logging and eliminated hanging issues during timestamp calculation
  - Maintains accurate file modification timestamps while providing massive performance improvement
